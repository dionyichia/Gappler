# Sherman's Work Log

This is an append-only index of Sherman's Gappler work. Team task status, scheduling, and ownership
remain in [`../PROJECT_PLAN.md`](../PROJECT_PLAN.md).

## [2026-09-16] T0.2 | Network switch proof

- Evidence: [`T0.2_SESSION.md`](T0.2_SESSION.md)
- Verified: RM65 at `192.168.1.18` replied from host address `192.168.1.10`; MID-360 at
  `192.168.1.3` replied from host address `192.168.1.5`; both checks passed after a NetworkManager
  connection cycle.
- Outcome: Evidence supports closing shared-plan task T0.2, pending shared-doc review.
- Next: Send this evidence record to the Dion documentation owner.

## [2026-09-16] T0.9 | Base identity recorded

- Evidence: [`T0.9_BASE_FOOTPRINT.md`](T0.9_BASE_FOOTPRINT.md)
- Verified: The supplied Hexman Robotics ECHO Series Product Manual v1.8.7 identifies the chassis as
  ECHO-PLUS, `460 x 380 x 140 mm`, with a `265 mm` stated rotation radius.
- Outcome: The manual's rotation radius exceeds the current `0.20 m` Nav2 radius by `0.065 m`.
  Physical integrated-robot measurement remains required before changing the navigation footprint.
- Next: Photograph the manufacturer/model label and measure the footprint with a tape measure.

## [2026-09-16] T5.2 | D455 mobile-base mount constraints

- Evidence: [`T5.2_D455_MOUNT.md`](T5.2_D455_MOUNT.md)
- Verified: The planned D455 base mount uses `20 x 20 mm` aluminum extrusion, with a required
  `190 mm` extrusion length.
- Outcome: Mount CAD and dimensions are reported complete. The provided D455 still needs USB 3 and
  live-stream verification; fabrication, anchor-point geometry, and arm-clearance measurement remain open.
- Next: Test the D455 under T0.1, then validate the completed design against the physical base before
  fabrication.
